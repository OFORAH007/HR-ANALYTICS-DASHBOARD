  JobSatisfaction,
  EducationField,
  YearsAtCompany,
  Attrition
FROM
  Employees;
```
```
Calculating Attrition rate by Department

SELECT
  Department,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS AttritionCount,
  COUNT(EmployeeID) AS TotalEmployees,
  (COUNT(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) * 1.0 / COUNT(EmployeeID)) * 100 AS AttritionRate
FROM
  Employees
GROUP BY
  Department
ORDER BY
  AttritionRate DESC;
```
```
Analyzing Attrition by Job role & Satisfaction 

SELECT
  JobRole,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS AttritionCount,
  COUNT(EmployeeID) AS TotalEmployees,
  AVG(JobSatisfaction) AS AverageJobSatisfaction
FROM
  Employees
GROUP BY
  JobRole
ORDER BY
  AttritionCount DESC;
```
